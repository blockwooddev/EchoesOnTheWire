# Echoes on the Wire

In 2016, our creative coding group was invited to participate in a show about death and the afterlife entitled Wake. Barry Lockwood and I decided to resuscitate some dead technology for our part of the exhibit. A rotary phone was gutted and rebuilt with modern electronics to allow recording and playback of audio on the phone. Historic moments captured in audio could be dialed up by the participant using the rotary input. Dialing a zero allowed recording of messages that would stay in the phone's memory forever and play back at random moments. Distortion and reverb added extra element to go along with the theme of the show.

An embedded linux computer provided the ability to record and playback audio. Interfacing with the 1960s technology was easier than expected and we were able to not only read the state of the handset but also the exact number dialed. Python was used to capture this input and send it onto Pure Data via OSC. From there PD was in charge of audio generation, capturing, and effects. It was chosen for its ability to run on embedded linux and the quick build time it provided us. The phone has so much more potential that we hope to build upon with future ideas.
